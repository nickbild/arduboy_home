When submitting changes via a pull request, or any other means, please format commit messages using ["50/72" guidelines, as suggested by Tim Pope](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

Summary:
- Maximum 50 character first "title" line, written as a capitalized [imperative sentence](http://examples.yourdictionary.com/imperative-sentence-examples.html).
- If necessary, more detailed explanatory paragraphs following a blank line, with lines wrapped at maximum 72 characters.
- If used, bullet points have a "hanging indent".
